# Mathrems : Building Blocks for ML

Welcome to Mathrem, a repository dedicated to mastering essential mathematical concepts relevant to machine learning and artificial intelligence. This project serves as a practical resource for exploring topics in linear algebra, probability and statistics, and calculus.

## Contents

- **Linear Algebra**: Concepts related to vectors, matrices, transformations, and eigenvalues.
- **Probability & Statistics**: Exploration of distributions, hypothesis testing, and descriptive statistics.
- **Calculus**: Fundamentals of derivatives, integrals, and limits.

## Goals

- To build a strong mathematical foundation for machine learning applications.
- To practice and implement mathematical concepts through coding and problem-solving.
- To create a resource for others interested in enhancing their math skills for AI and ML.
